        <h2>It's all about me</h2>
        <p>I’m excited to share that I’m working on a project where I’m converting my resume into a web application. Imagine a sleek, interactive platform where you can click through my experiences, skills, and achievements.
        I’m using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to make it visually appealing and user-friendly.</p>
